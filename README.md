# TEAM BruteForce - Crack the Covid-19 Crisis Hackathon

### Our solution consist of three parts:

1.	First part is **a remote education android app** which resolves all the problem stated above. It contains all the features a student will want in his/her app. We tried to involve every activity that we use to do in offline college times in this App.
It consists of **Video call functionality with a special feature of blocking students who are speaking abusive or bad words during a live session. The student will be reported to the admin of the app and all the records of the blocked student will be sent to the admin app. Admin can unblock the student again.** 
Then our app contains a **chat room** for each classroom a student is enrolled in, it will allow the students and teachers to communicate as they use to do in Offline College.
Then comes the **appointment feature**. Before contacting any teacher we have to make an appointment with him/her to ask for their time. So our App includes this cool feature of appointment for the students. This reduces the chaos and brings the working thing so that follows proper protocol.
Teachers wanted an invigilation system to invigilate students during the test. In our App we provided this feature by **camera proctored examination feature**. Under this a teacher can proctor all students through their webcams while the students are giving tests, also the teacher can pass their voice in the whole class to convey messages during tests.
Also our app has a feature of **assignment submission**. The teachers can upload the assignment questions along with the due date and students on the other hand can upload the solutions of these tests on the app itself.

## We’ve used IBM’s Watson Speech to text service to convert the speech of students during live video into text in a loop and we used this text in our algorithm to detect if someone is speaking bad or abusive language. Once our algorithm detect that, the user will blocked from the online channel and then he will have to ask the admin to un-block himself/herself.

2.	Our second part of the solution consists of an **IoT device, an Image processing algorithm, artificial intelligence and an android app. combining all makes a ROBOCARE package for helping Covid19 doctors and patients**
To help treat Covid19 patients we invented a robot that can be used as an essentials deliverable device or like a wheelchair. The robot work on the gesture made by hands. We don’t have to touch anything to operate the robot just make gestures and transfer medicines and food to patients through this robot. 
Due to Covid19 treatment people are becoming weak so this robot can act as a wheelchair also for easy transportation through mere gestures.

#### The Youtube link to this IoT technology can be found here

Also we devised an IOT device that will measure the **temperature and heartbeat of the patient and will transfer all this data to the cloud which is connected with an App that will be updated on a real-time basis and will give alerts to doctor on the mobile app. This will help in social distancing and contactless treatment.**
Through our Image processing algorithm, we will allow the patients to make some **face gesture(can indicate discomfort, urge, cough, etc) and through these gestures, with the aid of HAAR cascades in the image processing and AI part of the app**, an **alarm will ring** in the doctor’s phone having our android App. **Here, the caretaker can be  doctor, a child's parent or a guardian, and can be used in homes, care homes, hospitals and quarantine centers**

3. Along with this we have a **covid19 case detector using Tableau for use for friends and family**, wherein you can track data from January 1 2020 to the present date. Thus you can study the number of cases and deaths for 210 countries and territories, the data for which has been taken from [EU data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data/resource/260bbbde-2316-40eb-aec3-7cd7bfc2f590) Find it here at our Tableau public. ( https://public.tableau.com/profile/elio.jordan.lopes#!/vizhome/COVID-19-TRACKER-ELIO/COVID19DASHBOARD?publish=yes ) . 



Using Tableau we have also made a **Trump Tweet Analysis Active** dashboard which the Twitterati can use during the COVID-19 pandemic to learn about the latest happening and tweets from POTUS Donald Trump. The frequency of the tweet is monitored along with identifying keywords like 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'democrats' , 'Biden', 'Obama' etc. The same technology can be used to track tweets realted to domestic violence, abuse during these chaotic and quarantined times to promote a sense of security, as Tableau provided smart technology with its unique data and visualising functionalities.
